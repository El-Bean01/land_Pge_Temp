#is adding the photo to the top section and adding the photo boxes to the service boxes for screen shots.

#11/24/25 9:30am - last added the section for the screenshots and google form. need to add <img> and work on the google form. left off adding in the profile pic section. 

#11/26/25 7:50am - things are harder to pick back up from a day of not coding try not to do that again. decided against the google form, wanted to just have a simple message sent to my email, I went with form submit instead for quick use. need to add photos to the folder and start tweaking the details.
